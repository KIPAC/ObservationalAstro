To build the Jupyter Book use: ``jupyter-book build --all book``

To publish it to the website use: ``ghp-import -n -p -f book/_build/html``

**Note:** There is a GitHub Action set up which will automatically run these commands every time there is a new commit to the main branch, so don't commit anything there unless you want it to be immediately published.
