# Shared Data

Astronomy benefits from a culture of sharing data, and many discoveries are made using publicly accessible data archives. We will be building our own community archive during this class in the form of a shared Google Drive folder, which we will link shortly. We recommend making a shortcut to this folder in your own Google Drive, **ideally directly in `My Drive` rather than a subfolder**, so that the data can be easily accessed from Google Colab with the same path for everyone.

Managing files can quickly become *very tedious* in this class, especially when sharing data between groups, so we will follow a standard structure for the shared folder. Science exposures will be placed in `<object_name>/<observation_date>` with filter and exposure time information in the file name. Calibration files will be placed in `calibration/<observation_date>` with prefixes `flat_`, `dark_`, and `bias_`. Files from a night of observing M3 last year are already there as an example, please take a quick look. We provide a nice way to load and process files from this structure using Python dictionaries in Lab 0.3. It pays to be organized here!
