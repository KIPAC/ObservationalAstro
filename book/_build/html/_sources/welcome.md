# Welcome to Physics 100!

This class provides an introduction to **Observational Astronomy**, in 
particular to making and analyzing astronomical observations and to the astronomy 
profession in general. The class is designed for advanced undergraduate physics majors 
but is open to all undergraduate students with a calculus based physics background. We 
will explore and practice how astronomers take projects from initial ideas, through data 
collection and analysis, to write-up and presentation. Topics in lecture will include: 
navigating the night sky, telescope instrumentation and operation, the physics of stars 
and galaxies, statistical analysis, and effective scientific communication. We will also 
introduce several hot topics in astrophysics and cosmology.

The purpose of this website is to:
 - provide up-to-date schedules for observing nights, labs, lectures, and the final project
 - host assignments: Jupyter Notebooks can be easily opened with Google Colab
 - link additional resources which may prove useful as the course progresses
 - show off the awesome things we do with the Stanford Student Observatory

Important things not on the website are:
 - Canvas announcements
 - Google Drive folder for shared data [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BZ1Dcfbq3Uc8_xyb6rxHeSY-Jjhz8sNh)
 - Solutions for assignments
