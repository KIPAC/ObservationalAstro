# Shared Data

Astronomy benefits from a culture of sharing data, and many discoveries are made using publicly accessible data archives. We will be building our own community archive during this class in the form of a shared Google Drive folder. We recommend making a shortcut to this folder in your own Google Drive, **ideally directly in `My Drive` rather than a subfolder**, so that the data can be easily accessed from Google Colab with the same path for everyone.

**The shared Google Drive folder is [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BZ1Dcfbq3Uc8_xyb6rxHeSY-Jjhz8sNh).**

Managing files can quickly become *very tedious* in this class, especially when sharing data between groups, so we will follow a standard structure for the shared folder. Science exposures will be placed in `data/<object_name>/<observation_date>/<telescope>/` with filter and exposure time information in the file name. Calibration files will be placed in `data/calibration/<observation_date>/<telescope>/` with prefixes `flat_`, `dark_`, and `bias_`. Files from a night of observing M51 last year are already there as an example, please take a quick look. (Note: we cheated and pulled darks from a nearby night... don't do this!) We provide a nice way to load and process files from this structure using Python dictionaries in Lab 0.2. It pays to be organized here!
