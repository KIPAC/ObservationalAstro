# Final Projects


## Potential Project Topics

Imaging:
 - Determining the physical properties of nebulae or nearby spiral galaxies with narrow band imaging (star formation rate, ionization properties, etc.)
 - Determining the distances to star clusters with variable stars.
 - Studying an extrasolar planet through the photometric detection of a transit.
 - Characterizing the short and long-term variability of AAVSO stellar targets.
 - Photometric characterization of a bright transient event (if one happens).

Spectroscopy (if available). Note: an additional investment of time will be required for teams to learn how to operate the new spectrograph.
 - Determining the physical properties of nebulae or spiral galaxies with spectroscopic data (star formation rate, ionization properties etc)
 - Measuring the rotation curve of a nearby spiral galaxy (dark matter search).
 - Spectroscopic characterization of a bright transient event (if one happens).
