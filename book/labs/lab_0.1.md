# Lab 0.1: The Night Sky

*Due: Saturday, April 5 at 11:59 PM.*

This lab delves deeper into the night sky. By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
 - use planetarium software to simulate the night sky
 - describe how the night sky changes over short and long time periods

## Simulating the Night Sky

Use the [Stellarium](http://www.stellarium.org/) planetarium software to view the night sky as it will appear during your next observing session on April 9 and over the course of a year. Answer the questions below.
  
1. When does the Sun set? Recalling how light scatters in the atmosphere, qualitatively describe when astronomical observations can start.
2. When does the Moon set and rise? What phase is the Moon in?
3. List 5 visible constellations.
4. What direction do they appear to move as the night progresses?
5. Identify 3 additional constellations that you can see now, but which you will not be able to see in half a year. Identify 3 which will still be visible. How does this relate to their position on the sky? 
6. Can the motion of the Moon with respect to the background stars be observed during this 2 hour period? 
7. Estimate the Moon's apparent speed with respect to the background stars in arcminutes per hour. To do this, you can either use Stellarium, or your knowledge about the motions of the Moon and the sky. Provide an answer for this question even if the Moon is not visible during this particular observing session. 
8. What planets are visible?
9. What right ascension is overhead (at zenith) when your observing session starts and when it ends? 
10. Tabulate the change in the phase of the Moon and its rise time for each Wednesday observing lab through the whole quarter (April 9 - early June). Qualitatively explain any patterns that you observe.


## Exploring the Night Sky's Contents

Select one object from the [Messier catalogue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Messier_objects) or one image from the [Astronomy Picture of the Day](http://apod.nasa.gov) that features an object observable with a small telescope.

11. Copy and cite a brief summary of the object from the internet.
12. Write down at least three scientific questions that you have about the image or object. Which of these do you think could be answered using one of the telescopes Stanford Student Observatory?

 - Constellations: Google is your quickest resource for finding out about the stars and objects within each constellation and its mythological history. You can also check out a field guide, such as \emph{Stars and Planets} by Ian Ridpath and Wil Tirion. Additional resources:
